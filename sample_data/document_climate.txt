Climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing humanity
in the 21st century. It refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and
weather patterns, largely driven by human activities such as burning
fossil fuels.

The accumulation of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane in
the atmosphere traps heat, leading to global warming. Consequences of
climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather
events, droughts, floods, and disruptions to ecosystems.

Addressing climate change requires coordinated global action, including
reducing emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and
adapting infrastructure. Public awareness, scientific research, and
policy decisions all play critical roles in mitigating climate-related
risks.

The future of the planet depends on the choices made today to protect
natural systems and ensure sustainability for future generations.
