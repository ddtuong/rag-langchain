Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make
decisions. The history of AI dates back to the 1950s when researchers
first explored the idea of creating machines capable of reasoning like
humans.

Over the decades, AI has evolved through several waves, including
symbolic AI, expert systems, machine learning, and deep learning. Modern
AI systems rely heavily on large datasets, powerful computing resources,
and advanced algorithms such as neural networks.

Applications of AI are widespread, ranging from natural language
processing and computer vision to healthcare diagnostics, finance, and
autonomous vehicles. Despite its benefits, AI also raises ethical
concerns such as bias, data privacy, transparency, and the impact on
employment.

As AI continues to advance, responsible development and governance are
essential to ensure that these technologies benefit society as a whole.
